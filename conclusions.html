<p>This is the end of this expedition. There are a lot of things that
  I didn't had time to try. Here are a few of them.</p>

<p>As we saw, the number of external symbols is quite big. Even one
  file system can have hundreads and we end up with more than a
  thousand symbols when we consider a decent selection of file
  systems. This makes tracking each symbol individually not very
  informative. One way to reduce the complexity is to try to classify
  them. Doing this manually could be accomplished by somebody familiar
  with that respective kernel but some automatic method might be also
  attempted. With this classification in place, the way the file
  systems are using various classes of symbols could become more
  meaningful.<p/>

<p>Another direction, which increases complexity, would be to take in
  consideration not only that a kernel module is using a certain
  external symbol but also from how many different places from inside
  its code it is doing this. This information is contained in the
  relocation table of the object file and it can be easily extracted
  using <em>objdump</em>.</p>

<p>From the personal side I can say that figuring how to get all the
  Linux modules was kind of cool and learning about the way
  hierarchical clustering works was very informative. The fact that
  BSDs have a system release with each of their kernels (or conversely,
  that they make a new kernel release with each system release) made
  them much easier to deal with. Their archives, which contain
  binaries going all the way back to the very beginning, represents a
  very valuable resource which could be used to track their
  evolution.</p>

<p>Some trivia. There are 78 regular figures (out of which 10 have
  high-detail versions) and 4 animations. The building of the
  phylogenetic tree for all the 2.6.x took about tree days of
  continuous running on a P4 at 2.8 GHz. The memory consumption was
  decent though, only 200 MB. Before settling to the final Circos
  graph I generated more than 50 circular plots showing the relations
  between each file systems with everybody else. All of them look very
  similar though. Except the circos plot and the the treemap all the
  others are done in R. The treemap was obtained using
  GrandPerspective and Inkscape.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading! And once again, if you find any mistake
  please let <a href="mailto:razvanm@cs.jhu.edu">me</a> know.</p>
