Friday, May 29, 2009
--------------------

Thursday, May 28, 2009
----------------------

 o pars graph with all the 2.6.x
 o high-detail graph for pars with all the 2.6.x
 o high-detail of the cluterings for 2.6.x

Wednesday, May 27, 2009
-----------------------

 o start working on clustering using the canberra metric

Tuesday, May 26, 2009
---------------------

 o clustering over the whole 2.6.x
 o work on a circular representation for the clustering of the whole
   2.6.x 

Monday, May 25, 2009
--------------------

 o finish the external symbols over time ("hairy state")
 o boxplots for the external symbols over time
 o ranking graphs for: longevity, range, biggest jump, biggest decrease

Sunday, May 24, 2009
--------------------

 o finish the circular representation for pars on tux3
 o pars fail (memory problem) when I run it on all the 1377 file
   systems from 2.6.x (solved)
 o heatmaps animation for Hamming + ward/complete/average/mcquitty
 o start working on the external symbols over time ("hairy state")

Saturday, May 23, 2009
----------------------

 o plot the tree from pars as a dendrogram in R
 o start building a circular plot of the pars' tree

Friday, May 22, 2009
--------------------

 o finish the text for the tux3 section
 o add anchors to the figures

Tuesday, May 19, 2009
---------------------

 o make a complete version of the external symbols for the tux3 tree
 o make some figures to show how clustering works
 o write more text

Monday, May 18, 2009
--------------------

 o add two more graphs with the number of external calls
 o write more text

Friday, May 15, 2009
--------------------

 o add one more graph showing the size of kernel trees as tar.bz2,
   unpacked and after the file systems were compiled
 o write more text about the building process

Thursday, May 14, 2009
----------------------

 o debug the building scripts

   I'm using gcc 4.1.3 and binutild 2.19.1. To get the 2.6.17-2.6.21
   to compile I had to add:
      #include <limits.h>
   to scripts/mod/sumversion.c.

 o add to the scorecard graph markers for failed attempt to compile
 o start to format a pdf version in scribus
 o read more about how various clustering algorithms works


Wednesday, May 13, 2009
-----------------------

 o add more dendrograms using two new metrics: Canberra and
   binary. For each four clustering algorithms (ward, complete,
   average, mcquitty) are used.
 o reorder the tick graphs based on the clustering results
 o quick note: the scorecard shows now 1377 filesystems.

Tuesday, May 12, 2009
---------------------

 o redraw the R heatmaps. There is only one metric (the hamming
   distance) but 4 algorithms for clustering are presented (ward,
   complete, average and McQuitty).

Monday, May 11, 2009
--------------------
 
 o some fine tuning of the treemap
 o some tuning of the css and the text for several captions
 o add one a graph on the bottom of the scorecard which shows the date
   of each kernel release
 o some reading to better explain how hierarchical clustering works and
   what algorithms are available in R

Sunday, May 10, 2009
--------------------

 o fix the 2D track with external symbols to trully represent
   percentages
 o determine the links between filesystems (jdb, jdb2, lockd, etc) and
   use it to plot ribbons in the Circos plot
 o treemap using Grand Perspective

Saturday, May 9, 2009
---------------------

 o add a 2D track with the percentage of external symbols unique to
   each filesystem

 o classify the filesystems in categories

disk: btrfs, ext2, ext3, ext4, fat, freevxfs, hfsplus, jfs, ntfs, qnx4, reiserfs, tux3, xfs
special: isofs, udf
flash: cramfs, jffs, jffs2, openpromfs, romfs, squashfs, ubifs
network: 9fs, afs, cifs, coda, ncpfs, nfs, nfsd, smbfs, intermerzzo
ancient-disk: adfs, affs, befs, bfs, efs, hfs, hpfs, minix, omfs, sysv, ufs
misc: autofs, autofs4, configfs, debugfs, devfs, devpts, dlm, ecryptfs, exportfs, fuse, hugetlbfs, jbd, jbd2, lockd, nls, patitions, proc, ramfs, sysfs
cluster: gfs2, ocfs2

autofs;autofs4;configfs;debugfs;devfs;devpts;dlm;encryptfs;exportfs;fuse;hugetlbfs;jdb;jdb2;lockd;nls;partitions;proc;ramfs;sysfs

 o Some peculiarities: proc doesn't build with CONFIG_PROC_FS=m in the
   make command. It compiles fine otherwise. Also strange is openprom
   which is not enable and failes when the =m is forsed in the make command.

 o Improve the runone script to first try to compile without forcing
   the module and then forced if the desired object file was not
   produces. This brought the number of compiled filesystems for the
   tux3 tree to 55.

 o Reorder filesystems based on the categories. This generated a much
   nicer picture.

Friday, May 8, 2009
-------------------

 o build the kernel for linux-tux3
 o Google deprecated the SOAP API and the one (AJAX) doesn't seem to
   return the number of matches
 o one more plots in Circos in which System.map is depicted. The bands
   will represent this time the type of external symbol and the size
   will be proportional with the number.
 o add a 2D track with the popularity of the external symbols
