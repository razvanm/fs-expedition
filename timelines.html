    In gray are depicted the development branches and the small ticks
    from the the 2.6 branch are the minor releases. The minor that
    sticks out is the 2.6.16. The data was extracted from the
    timestamps of the files served by <em>kernel.org</em>. Tho dates,
    for 2.1.25 and 2.1.26 were wrong and were manually adjusted. The
    only omitted releases are the 2.2.0pre1 to 2.2.pre9.  <br />
    <br /> Note that the proportion between the left (stable) and
    right (development) axes is 1 to 3.

    The data for this graph was collected from two sources: the
    <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/releases/">/releases/</a> which
    provides month accuracy dates and also the modification time for the
    the <a href="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386/7.2-RELEASE/"><tt>x.x-RELEASE/README.TXT</tt></a>
    directories. The 2.2.9 release was announce on April 1st, 2006
    with
    a <a href="http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-announce/2006-April/001055.html">funny message</a>.

    The NetBSD 3.1 and 3.0.2 were released simultaneously with the
    former containing several new features beside the critical
    bugfixes from the latter. The situation is similar for NetBSD 2.1
    and 2.0.3 but they were released 3 days apart from each other
    (2.0.3 was the first).

    <a name="openbsd" id="openbsd"><span class="sans"><b>Timeline of the OpenBSD releases.</b></span></a>

    The data was collected using the modification timestamps from
    the <a href="ftp://ftp.eu.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/pub/OpenBSD/4.5/i386/"><tt>x.x/i386/MD5</tt></a>. As
    the <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq1.html#Next">FAQ</a>
    indicates, the releases are 6 months apart. As Dr. Lamar says
    in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119177/quotes">Gattaca</a>: <em>Jerome,
    Jerome, the metronome.</em>
